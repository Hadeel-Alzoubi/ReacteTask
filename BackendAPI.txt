Backend/API:
        Use .NET Core to create a RESTful API to handle the CRUD operations.
        Set up a SQL Server database to store the auditing data.
        Create endpoints for the following operations:
            Create an audit entry
            Retrieve all audit entries
            Retrieve a specific audit entry by ID
            Update an audit entry
            Delete an audit entry

    Frontend:
        Use React to create the user interface for the CRUD operations.
        Use Bootstrap or any other CSS framework for the frontend design.
        Create pages/components for the following functionalities:
            List all audit entries
            View details of a specific audit entry
            Add a new audit entry
            Edit an existing audit entry
            Delete an audit entry (with confirmation)

    Integration:
        Connect the frontend and backend by making API calls from the React components to the .NET Core API endpoints.
        Ensure that the frontend communicates with the backend for all CRUD operations.

    Additional considerations:
        Implement input validation on the backend to ensure data integrity.
        Handle errors and display appropriate error messages to the user.
        Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the list of audit entries if there are a large number of records.


This task will assess your understanding of .NET Core APIs, React, database integration, and frontend design using Bootstrap.
 It will also test your ability to handle CRUD operations and implement a responsive user interface.
